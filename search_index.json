["index.html", "The Potato-Peel Cookbook No ads, no stories, just recipes 1 Introduction", " The Potato-Peel Cookbook No ads, no stories, just recipes Casey Jelsema Last updated: 2020-05-16 1 Introduction Note: This is still a work in progress. This note will be removed when all of my “regular” recipes are added. Other recipes will get added over time. I may also play with the formatting of the book or adding nutrition information. The “tools” are not always consistently listed. I generally try to list the few major things. Minor things like measuring cups for measuring ingredients, I usually don’t bother. This cookbook is mainly for my own use, though I’ll probably post the link now and again. The name is a homage to the book and movie The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, mainly because of a line from the movie that I’ve co-oped for the subtitle. I’m not a chef by any stretch, so I look up recipes online. But we all know that recipe websites are terrible. They’re either riddled with ads, or have a 3-page story about some rando’s spiritual experience with chives that one time before getting to the recipe. That’s all we’re there for: The ingredients and the directions. That’s what I’m doing here. That is to say, I’m usually not the inventor of these recipes. Sometimes I’ve tweaked them a bit, sometimes not. Usually I’ll provide a link to the original source in case you want to read some story about how garlic is friendly but pepper is moody. Chances are you don’t want to, because that’s stupid. I used to keep recipes I used regularly, or that I liked and wanted to keep around, in a Google Document, but the app would sometimes restart when flipping around tabs. That got annoying, so I decided to write it up in an e-book. Most if not all of the recipes are dairy-free, due to a household need for this. The recipes may just mention “milk” or “butter”, etc, but I’ll have a note about the dairy-free alternative. A word of caution on this: Almond milk is often sweetened and/or flavored with vanilla. That can throw off some of the recipes (especially the gravy). If you do use it, look for unsweetened and unflavored almond milk. If you found this, I hope it’s useful. If not, I don’t really care. Also, hopefully you won’t ever read this introduction again, because y’all just want the recipe. "],

Put butter in skillet and place in oven to melt. Mix all of the other ingredients in a mixing bowl. Once butter is melted and skillet it warm, remove from oven, pour in batter, and return to oven. The skillet should be warm/hot, so that there is an immediate crisping of some of the batter. The whole thing will puff up a lot, but then collapse once you take it out. Bake for 20 minutes. Then reduce temp to 300 and bake 5 more minutes. Variations: Change the amount and/or type of spice to suit your taste. I like cinnamon, nutmeg works. Maybe thyme if you’re weird. Notes: If being diary-free is no concern, you can use regular milk. "],

But be CAREFUL, it will burn easily. Variations: Add some cinnamon to the batter. I forget how much I use, will update next time I made french toast. Notes: If being diary-free is no concern, you can use regular milk. Recipie can be increased or decreased, egg-to-milk ratio should be approximately 1/3 cup of milk for each egg (or possibly slightly less, maybe 1/4 cup milk for each egg). the sugar-to-egg ratio should be about 1/4 tbsp sugar per egg.

["waffle-batter.html", "2.3 Waffle batter", " 2.3 Waffle batter Of the breakfast foods made with batter, waffles are the best.

Variations: For Sourdough Waffles: Use 300 g starter. Reduce milk to 300 g and flour to 175 g. A different version of yeasted waffles, which doesn’t require a sourdough started, is found at post number 5 by “Queen Bruin” here. I tried it once and didn’t find it worth the effort. Notes: If being diary-free is no concern, you can use regular milk. Don’t always trust the time on the waffle iron. I just let it cook until it’s basically done steaming, or a bit more. "],

["biscuits.html", "3.2 Biscuits", " 3.2 Biscuits Technically biscuits are more versatile than just using them for biscuits and gravy, but what’s the point? Source: MinimalistBaker Ingredients: IngredientsTools1 cup almond milkMixing bowl1 tbsp lemon juice / apple cider vinagerMeasuring cup275 g flour (~2 cups)Mixing spoon1 tbsp baking powderKnife/Dough scraper1/2 tsp baking soda9x9 pan3/4 tsp salt4 tbsp butter Preparation: Preheat the oven to 450° F. Mix the almond milk and lemon juice or apple cider vinager. This will simulate buttermilk. Let it stand for at least 5 minutes. Whisk together dry ingredients. Cut the butter (if you used sticks, which I suggest) into small chunks and mix it in with the flour. Just use your fingers to smash the pieces further and try to incorporate it as well as possible. The more distributed it gets, the better. But don’t use melted butter, and try to work quickly so that the butter doesn’t melt from your hands. Pour in the “buttermilk” mixture. Stir until just slightly combined, the dough will be very sticky. Dump it out onto floured surface, dust the top with some flour, and fold the dough over itself a few times (5-6 should be fine). You’ll probably want to dust your hands with flour now and again. Your hands WILL become a sticky mess. DO NOT KNEAD THE DOUGH. Handle the dough as little as possible. Otherwise you lose fluffiness and biscuits become more hard (I think). Form the dough into a rough square/disk approximately 3/4 - 1 inch thick. Use a dough cutter, knife, or cookie cutter to cut out the biscuits. Place them in greased baking sheet/pan. They should touch slightly (this helps them to rise). Brush tops of biscuits with melted butter (another 1/4 - 1/2 tbsp) and gently make a small divot in the center (using 1-2 fingers). This helps prevent “dome” forming from biscuits. Bake for 10-15 minutes, until the bisuits are fluffy and turning golden brown. Eat those bad boys while they’re warm! Preferably with sausage gravy. Variations: Cinnamon roll biscuts are pretty good. I actually like them better than “ordinary” cinnamon rolls. Notes: Of course, swap out the butter for dairy-free butter to make this fully dairy-free. The original recipe was for vegan biscuits, hence the almond milk in the instructions. If you don’t are about being vegan or dairy-free, you can swap out both of those ingredients for buttermilk. "],
["cinnamon-roll-biscuits.html", "3.3 Cinnamon roll biscuits", " 3.3 Cinnamon roll biscuits Okay, so this is at least one good use for biscuits other then biscuits and gravy. Source: No particular source, just made it up (we were out of both eggs and breakfast sausage one day). Ingredients: DoughFillingTools1 cup almond milk2 tbsp cinnamonMixing bowls1 tbsp lemon juice / apple cider vinager2 tbsp brown/coconut sugarMixing spoon275 g flour (~2 cups)GlazeKnife/Dough scraper1 tbsp baking powder1 cup powdered sugar9x9 pan1/2 tsp baking soda2 tbsp dairy free butterI didn't keep track of everything3/4 tsp salt1 tbsp almond milkStop complaining, this is all free4 tbsp butter1 tsp vanilla extractIncluding ad-free Preparation: Preheat the overn to 450° F. Make the dough from the biscuit recipie. Mix the filling in a small dish. Very tricky, this step. As you are folding the dough over itself, spread some of the filling in it to fold into the dough. I wound up using two folds for this. Try to aim for making a “long” rectangle rather than a square. Then on your last fold, roll the dough instead of folding it. It might look terrible, and that’s fine, I won’t judge how your cinnamon rolls look. Use a knife or dough scraper to slice the log of dough into disks, about 1 - 1.5 inches thick. Place them in the baking pan. They can touch each other, or there can be a bit of space, it doesn’t matter that much. Brush the tops with some melted butter and bake for 10-15 minutes. While the biscuits are baking, you can make the glaze. If you do this well before the biscuits are done cooking, it will have a chance to congeal slightly. Melt the butter. Add the powdered sugar, almond milk, and vanilla extract and whisk until smooth. When the cinnamon biscuits are done, try to let them cool before drizzling with the glaze, as that will help prevent it from all running down the sides. If you let he glaze cool a bit, that will also help in this regard. Variations: You should throw some butter on these when you go to eat them. But that’s redundant with cinnamon rolls, right? Notes: If being diary-free is no concern, you can use regular milk and butter. I like these better than “ordinary” cinnamon rolls that use a yeasted dough. "],
["sausage-gravy.html", "3.4 Sausage gravy", " 3.4 Sausage gravy A staple of the South, this is basically a must-have to go along with biscuits. Source: Passed-down directions. Ingredients: IngredientsToolsBreakfast sausageFrying pan or skilletFlourSpoon or forkAlmond milk Preparation: In the pan/skillet, fry the sausage. Smash it a bit to make it produce more grease. The more the better. Add approximately equal parts almond milk and stir together. The milk should start to cook off so that the gravy thickens up. Add salt and pepper to taste. If you want more, add more flour and milk. If it’s too runny, add some flour only, or let some of hte milk cook off. Put it on fresh biscuits and get fat enjoy. Add a sausage patty on the biscuit as well. Variations: Use bacon instead of sausage. Not as great with the resulting gravy, in my opinion, but is a source of grease. Plus, you get bacon. If the sausage didn’t break up at all, you may want to add some bits of the sausage back into he gravy. Notes: Breakfast sausage comes in many forms. I try to avoid links or pre-made patties, as I think they tend to produce less grease, and less little bits of sausage that fall off to get mixed in with the gravy. I mentioned this in the introduction, but for this recipe especially, don’t use sweetened or flavored almond milk. It’ll still work, but it definitely changes the flavor in a way that I don’t really like. "],
["huevos-rancheros.html", "3.5 Huevos Rancheros", " 3.5 Huevos Rancheros A popular southwest / Mexican style breakfast. I view it a bit like a pizza: There’s a generally agreed-upon basis, but plenty of room for variation. Below is how I like to make them. Source: Experimentation. Ingredients: IngredientsTools1/8 lb chorizo sausageAll of your frying pans1-2 EggsSpatulaBlack beansCornChile (green or red)Tortilla Preparation: Start frying the chorizo. Personally, I like to break it up into many chunks and fry it to the point that it gets a bit crispy or crunchy. While the chorizo is frying, put some chile, beans, and corn into a smaller pan and set it on very low heat. It’s just supposed to get warm. I throw some olive oil in the pan as well. If you don’t have chile, you can use salsa as a substitute, but know that I’m judging you for it. When the chorizo is done, put it on a plate and crash 1-2 eggs into the pan. Prepare them how you like, my preference is over-medium, but scrambled is also good. While the egg is cooking, use another pan to crisp the tortilla. Depending on how quickly your eggs finish, you might need to start this before the eggs. When the tortilla has a bit of crisp (on both sides), put it on your plate, add the eggs, add some of the chile/corn/bean mixture, and add the chorizo. Variations: If you would rather your tortilla be soft, don’t fry it (one less pan, hooray!). You can just use it plain, or microwave it slightly. I like to add several more things to my huevos rancheros: Home fries, guacamole, cheese, and sometimes a drizzle of southwest dressing. Notes: Chorizo often comes in 1-pound packages. I ususally make huevos rancheros for two, so it’s easy to cook up 1/4 of the package. I tend to have a black bean and corn mixture on hand (literally just a can of black beans, and a can of corn, both drained, and then dumped into the same bowl). It goes great on salads, quesadillas, this, and probably more that I’m forgetting. If you don’t have that, you may want to make sure you have enough people to make brakfast for, have other uses for the corn and beans, or forgo the corn and beans. "],
["breakfast-scramble.html", "3.6 Breakfast scramble", " 3.6 Breakfast scramble This is a favorite of mine (though I like the huevos rancheros better). Very easy, filling, and delicious. Plenty of room for variation as well. Source: Imitating a fairly common restaurant dish. Ingredients: IngredientsTools2-3 medium red potatoesFrying pan/skillet x21/8 lb breakfast sausageSpatulas1-2 EggsOnionGreen pepperCooking oil Preparation: Set your skillet (if you have one, frying pan if not) to heating. I tend to do this at medium to medium/high heat. Dice up the potatoes. I usually make them into chunks about 1/4-1/2 inch. No need to peel them, just wash and cut off any roots that may have started growing. Throw some high-heat oil (such as avocado oil) or bacon grease into the skillet (if you have one, regular frying pan if not), and the dump in the potatoes. Be careful of oil/grease splattering. Stir the potatoes around to get them all coated with the oil, and then spread them as evenly as you can. In another pan, start frying the sausage. Occassionally stir the potatoes around so that they get crisped on all sides (this is the reason for the medium/high heat). Sautee a handful of diced onion and green peppers in a seperate pan (could be the one you used for sausage). Once the sausage is done, you can add it to the potatoes. Once your potatoes are almost done, start frying your egg(s) however you like. Scrambled works great, though I prefer over-medium. Mix up the potatoes, sausage, and onion/green peppers. Add the eggs on top, salt and pepper to taste. Variations: Some more Drizzle some BBQ sauce over the top. I rather like BBQ Carnivores sauces for this. Cheese is a good addition to this dish. A layer of sausage gravy also goes nicely with a scramble. Instead of breakfast sausage, you can use pulled pork or brisket. Notes: A slice of toast with butter complements this meal very nicely. You can put the onion and green pepper in with the potatoes, but then the potatoes tend to absorb the moisture and lose their crispyness, which I don’t like. "],

Notes: No need to drain the black beans, it just adds a bit of juice to the soup. You can blend one of the cans of beans (and some small amounts of other ingredients) independently, before adding them to the soup. I think the cooked beans blend better, though. "],

Add the yeast and whisk to dissolve. You can add some sugar here as well, I typically add 1/2 teaspoon. In around 5 minutes, the yeast should be bubbling. If it’s not, go back to the beginning. While the yeast is activating, measure out the flour, salt, and sugar into a mixing bowl. Dealer’s choice on whether you want to subtract any sugar used for the yeast from the overall recipe. Or add more, this is your pizza crust. Once the yeast is activated, pour it into the flour and start mixing. After a little bit the dough will start to form and get to a point where you can’t really mix it anymore. There will probably be some parts of the flour that are not fully incorporated in the dough. Once it gets to this point, dump it out onto a lightly floured surface. Make sure to get as much as you can, since you’ll be reusing the bowl. Knead by hand until the dough is somewhat smooth and elastic. You may need to be adding a bit more flour through this process so the dough ball doesn’t stick to your fingers or the counter. When it’s ready or your sick of kneading, form the dough into a ball, spray some oil into the mixing bowl and put the dough back in (as long as the bowl is reasonably clean). Cover it with a dish towel and let it sit to rise. The time you give for rising can vary. If you’re in a hurry, put the dough somewhere warm (e.g., on top of a preheating oven, or in a microwave with a glass of water you just boiled) for 10-15 minutes. If you have more time, you can let it rise for a couple hours. When the dough is ready (doubled in size from rising, or you’re getting hangry), dump it out onto a lightly floured surface (probably the same one as before). Sprinkle some flour on it, and roll it out - gently at first, I usually deflate it with my hands to start. I generally roll it out until it doesn’t really want to strech anymore. Gently lift the dough off the counter, and place it on an oiled cookie sheet or pizza pan. The way I roll it out, there is always extra. Cut off the excess, form a new dough ball and roll it out. Usually there is enough left over for a second (smaller) pizza, or for making garlic bread. You don’t have to, but I like to spray the dough with more olive oil before adding sauce. Then add the toppings you like. Bake the pizza at 425^{} F for 20 minutes. Keep an eye on it the first time or two, since you may want to adjust the time depending on your altitude or oven. Variations: The amounts of salt, sugar, and olive oil are pretty forgiving. I don’t measure the oil anymore, I just pour some from the bottle can call it good. If you know that you will have more or less time, you can adjust the yeast. Less yeast means you’ll need to allow more time for the dough to rise. I’ve cut the yeast in half before, and let the dough rise for 3-4 hours. Notes: I use a kitchen scale to measure ingredients, and adjusted the amounts You can use a stand mixer with dough hook to mix if you want, I find the amount of dough isn’t worth the hassle of using it. Maybe if you’re making multiple batches at once it would be. Directions for garlic bread and recipe for pizza sauce to come. Spoiler alter: The pizza sauce is basically just tomato sauce with a bunch of “Italian” herbs added, plus some salt, garlic, and red pepper flakes. "],

Add the herbs and spices. Mix it well. Variations: I think at least the first column of herbs and spices should be included. The second column is a bit less important. The herb/spice amounts were largely just guessing how much we normally used. Adjusting them will not change too much. I would recommend not going light on the oregano, though. If you want to make it thicker, add a small can of tomato paste as well. Though this will add volume, so you may want to put it in a pan and simmer it down a bit. Some recipes I looked up (but didn’t really copycat) also included some olive oil. I usually spray the dough before putting the sauce on, so I might get the same effect there. Notes: This amount is good for a pizza the size of a regular baking sheet. It may help to mix everything and actually simmer it for a bit. I usually don’t. "],
["garlicbread.html", "5.3 Garlic bread", " 5.3 Garlic bread Garlic bread is a fantastic side-kick to pizza. Source: I worked at a pizzaria one summer. IngredientsToolsExtra pizza doughRolling pinDairy-free butterKnifeGarlic powderBaking sheet/panParsleySalt Preparation: Make the pizza dough. The amounts I listed should accomodate an ordinary cookie sheet pizza, and have some leftover dough. Collect the scrap dough and form a dough ball. This will take a little bit to properly incorporate the scraps together. Roll out the new dough ball. You can roll it very thin if you like. Slather the top with butter. Like, a lot of it. It’s difficult to have too much here, I’m not sure that I’ve ever done so. Sprinkle with garlic powder (a lot), parsley (some), and salt (some). Very precise, I know. Set aside as the pizza cooks. The garlic bread should start to rise a bit, which is good. When the pizza is done, bake the garlic bread for approximatley 7 minutes. I think it’s done before all of the butter has cooked off. If it gets to that point, it usually means the garlic bread will be a bit more dry and/or crispy. Which, hey, if that’s what you like, more power so you. I don’t think this type of garlic bread is suited to being overly crispy. Variations: You can’t go wrong adding cheese (mozzerella and/or Provelone, naturally). Or Parmesan once it’s done baking. Notes: For the salt, it’s better if you have the style with larger grains/crystals (sea salt or other varieties mistakenly called sea salt, such as rock salt). This type of salt will get you the nice texture. If you’re in a hurry and don’t want to make the dough (or don’t have any extra), you can use a French bread instead. Cut it in half as if you’re making a sub sandwich and load it with butter. I like to cut 1-2 grooves lengthwise to get more butter into the bread. "],

I’ve used it as an appetizer with chips/crackers, put it on a roll, and make a grilled cheese with it. This is a dairy-free recipe (optionally vegan), but that makes the ingredient list a bit verbose, so I’ll list some options below. Source: AllRecipes, but I modified it to be dairy-free. Ingredients: Ingredients 8 oz cream cheese1/4 tsp garlic powder1/2 cup mayonnaise1/4 tsp paprika2 cups shredded cheddar cheese4 oz diced pimentos, drained1/4 tsp onion powderSalt and pepper to taste Preparation: Mix the cream cheese and mayonnaise together. Once the cream cheese and mayonnaise start to come together, add in the spices and continue mixing. Then add in the pimentos and continue mixing. Add the cheddar cheese shreds and mix well. Store in sealed container, seems to last pretty well. Might just be because pimento cheese is delicious and doesn’t last that long. Variations: Some of the following can be added to tweak the recipie slightly: Bacon bits (smoked is better) 1/4 tsp ground cayenne pepper 1 jalapeño pepper, de-seeded and minced I haven’t tried it yet, but adding some green chile would probably be good as well. If you use Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise, you may want to add white vinegar. I forget the amount, maybe1/4 cup or so. This helps mellow out the sweetness of the Miracle Whip, but does change the texture of the cheese to be a little bit more runny. Just use Duke’s mayo. Why don’t you have that stuff on hand anyway? Notes: As noted, this can easily be dairy-free. Our typical choices are: Shredded chedder cheese: Daiya Cream cheese: Tofutti "],

I think I swapped out on an equal-volume basis, and microwaved hte honey slightly so it would be easier to pour out of the measuring cup. Adding bacon bits and green chile (mixed into the batter) is great. If you don’t have proper green chile available, you can use jalapeño like a peasant. Notes: I like the Indian Head cornmeal. And since I got the recipie from their package, I think it’s only fair to recommend them for this. The top may crack during cooking. That’s fine.

Source: FlavorTheMoments Ingredients: IngredientsTools12 ounces chocolateTwo pots that will nest4 tsp coconut oilSpatula12 tbsp sugarSpoons + measuring cups1 tsp saltCupcake pan1/2 - 3/4 cup smooth peanut butter Preparation: Prepare a double boiler. This means: Put some water in the larger pot and set it to heating/boiling. Put the other pot in it, so that the water heats the inner pot, but it’s not directly touching the burner. Put cupcake wrappers in the tin. Add just over half of the chocolate to the inner pot (I usually use 7 ounces), and approximately half the coconut oil. Let melt (once they start, you can whisk/mix to help it along). Add 1 tbsp of sugar for each ounce of chocolate, and approximately half the salt. Whisk to spread evenly and let it dissolve. It may not fully dissolve, that’s okay. Distribute the melted chocolate across 12 cupcake wrappers. Shake/jiggle the pan to even it out if needed. In addition, I suggest tilting the pan in all directions to try and coat the sides of he wrappers with chocolate. Put the pan in the freezer for short amounts to let the edge set, and then do it again. I usually get 2-3 layers built up along the edges. Put the cupcake pan in the freezer to set the bottom. While the pan is in the freezer, start a second batch of chocolate for the top coat. When the first batch (sides and bottom) are ready, put the peanut butter in a microwave-safe cup and heat it (approximately 15-25 seconds to start) so that it will spread and pour more easily. Add peanut butter to each cup. Again shake/Jiggle the pan to settle the peanut butter, you don’t want it to be “mounded”. You may want to put the pan back in the freezer to set the peanut butter. Add the chocolate to the top of the peanut butter. Try to make sure the peanut butter is fully covered by the second layer of chocolate. Put the pan back in the freezer to set the chocolate. Optional: When it is mostly but not fully set, use a salt griner to grind some sea salt / rock salt on the top. If you do this too soon, the flakes will sink into the chocolate, which doesn’t look as fancy. Variations: I usually add a touch more salt. Maybe another 1/2 tsp or so. I’ve been tinkering with reducing the sugar. But don’t reduce it too much, otherwise these will be much more bitter. My first batch used 4 tbsp (I think for the top and the bottom each) and it was still quite bitter. Notes: Keep these in the fridge. They start getting melty easily. This recipe is for 12 peanut butter cups. If your cupcake pan isn’t that big, adjust accordingly. The chocolate I used was Bakers. Each box is 4 ounces, so I used 3 boxes at a time. The tops and bottoms of these peanut butter cups are a bit thick. Personally, I like that. If you have a second cupcake pan, you may be able to stretch the chocolate and get a few more peanut butter cups out of it. "],

Too much balsamic vinegar and your dressing may get a little clumpy at some point. Not a major problem, but something to be aware of. I normally don’t go more than 3/8 cup balsamic. Switching red wine vinegar for the balsamic gives a bit of a sweeter taste. We sometimes add some paprika. Notes: I use this OXO container, or at least something very much like it.

["kombucha.html", " 19 Kombucha", " 19 Kombucha This section will be a bit different, as it’s more of a process for a single thing, rather than recipes for multiple things. Kombucha is a fermented tea. That’s it, really. It has gained some popularity for a variety of reasons, including hipsters, probiotic content, and sometimes supposed health benefits. I don’t care about any of that, I just wanted to make it because I think it’s tasty and I was looking for a way to reduce how much soda I drank, but I like carbonation. The original recipe was from a friend, but it’s fairly basic and widespread from what I’ve seen. The r/kombucha subreddit has a master recipe that was basically identical. The basic overview to make kombucha is: Get your hands on a live culture. This can be purchased, or obtained from a local hippie / hipster. Brew a batch of sweet tea and mix in the culture. Let it ferment. Optionally flavor the fermented tea. Optionally bottle it and let it sit for a few days to build up carbonation. Since kombucha is a fermented drink, there is some alcohol. I haven’t even attempted to measure it, but from what I’m told (from speaking to someone who brews it commercially) the amount of alcohol is negligible. "],
["scoby.html", "19.1 SCOBY", " 19.1 SCOBY I’ll mention this word SCOBY throughout this chapter. Or if you look elsewhere online, you’ll come across it. What is it? It’s an acronym: Symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast. It’s similar to a sourdough starter: It’s what you need to get started. You feed it sweet tea, and it will grow. Then you set some aside for the next batch, and drink the rest. During the fermentation, the yeast will eat the sugar in your sweet tea, and the bacteria will produce acetic acid. As your kombucha brews, a film (well, starting at a film, it keeps growing over time) of bacterial cellulose will form on the top. Some folks call this film the SCOBY, some folks call it a mushroom, and some hipster-nerds insist that it should only be called a pellicle. I’ll probably alternate between mushroom and pellicle. Importantly, this mushroom is not needed for the process. I regularly throw mine out (or you can compost it, or do a variety of other things with it). Much more important is the starter liquid itself itself, as that’s where the culture really lives. Anytime I say “SCOBY”, I’m referring to the starter tea. Procuring a SCOBY You can buy a kombucha SCOBY / starter on Amazon, and then just maintain it. Or you might be able to find a local hippie who will give you some. If you’re on reddit, there is a subreddit called r/findascoby (and another one called r/kombucha where people often post various flavor combinations). SCOBY hotel I’ll also mention a “SCOBY hotel”. Some folks think that the mushroom is all-important, and want to make sure they have extra on hand either to give out, or to restart a batch if it gets infected with mold. So they have the extra jug full of these kombucha mushrooms and with a bit of the starter tea. That’s not my SCOBY hotel. Mine is just the starter tea. It grows a new/thicker mushroom constantly, but I periodically throw it out. My intent with the hotel is to have the backup starter liquid. "],
["equipment.html", "19.2 Equipment", " 19.2 Equipment I use the following items for making kombucha. Stock pot: A biggish one, mine is 8 quarts. You can get away with a smaller one if you want to brew a stronger tea and then dilute it*. I did that for a bit, but got annoyed, so I got a bigger one. E.g. To brew 2 gallons with a 1 gallon pot: Brew 1 gallon, and then mix with 1 gallon water. Requires some algebra for more complex ratios, but it’s doable. Tea diffuser: You don’t really NEED these, just if you want to use loose leaf tea. If you’d rather not, I think the ratio is roughly 4-6 tea bags per ounce of loose leaf. You’d want to look into that. I have two of these diffusers Big fermenting jugs: This is the main thing, some big jugs for the tea to sit in and ferment. I have 4 1-gallon jugs that I keep as “sets” of two. So each week I bottle two jugs and brew another batch to start them fermenting. I think these are the ones I use. I think they also sell as a 4-pack which might save a dollar or two. Bottles: The main thing is making sure that you can get a good sealing bottle that can withstand pressure. DO NOT USE SQUARE BOTTLES, they WILL explode. I used these swing-top bottles. From a 2-gallon batch, I usually get 12 bottles. So I have 5 packs of these for myself. I tried using mason jars for a bit, but the tops got dented from the pressure, and they didn’t carbonate well. pH strips: If you want to measure that. These are very much optional. I’m a nerd, I I wanted to test the pH. Also, I guess you’re “supposed” to make sure that your starting pH is below a certain level, so that the good bacteria and yeast outcompete the “bad” kind. The pH strips I used are these. They work okay, I guess. I’m not a chemist. Misc items A funnel. Pouring into the bottles is hard without one. I’ve been considering getting a siphon to make it easier. Not sure I want to clean that up though. Measuring cups both for the obvious reasons, and for scooping the finished kombucha into the bottles. I generally make 2-gallon batches, and this is enough to accomodate two people drinking approximately one bottle every day. I also have two batches fermenting at any given time, staggered by a week. Hence, the 2 tea diffusers, 4 fermenting jugs, and 30 bottles. If you anticipate less consumption, you won’t need as many bottles and fermenting jugs. "],
["ingredients.html", "19.3 Ingredients", " 19.3 Ingredients For a 1-gallon batch of kombucha, the recipe I use is this. As I mentioned, I make 2-gallon batches, so I double all this. 2 cups of the culture / starter / SCOBY 1 gallon of water to make the base tea (minus 2 cups to accomodate the culture, if you want to get really precise). 1 cup sugar. 2 ounces of tea (or 4-6 bags of tea, I think, I use 2 tablespoons of loose leaf). I use the turbinado / sugar in the raw, but that’s because I was taught by a colleague who’s a crunchy/granola sort. I have used regular sugar for a batch here and there and it turned out just fine. I also don’t really measure the water that precisely anymore. I know about where the 2-gallon mark on my stock pot is, so I just sort of approximate it. I also have an extra jug on hand. If I have a little extra kombucha one week, it gets added to the extra jug (a “SCOBY hotel”). If I need a little bit more, I take some from the hotel. If the hotel is getting full, I’ll get an extra bottle that wekk. "],
["directions.html", "19.4 Directions", " 19.4 Directions This got to be a bit longer than I wanted, so I broke it up into a couple sections. 19.4.1 First ferment 19.4.1.1 Brew the tea Dump all the water into your stock pot and get it heating up. At some point, dissolve in the sugar. Put the tea in whenever. I usually bring the water to a boil, take the pot off the stove, and then put in my tea diffusers. Wait for the tea to cool. If you put the SCOBY in too soon, the heat might kill the good bacteria or yeast. To speed this process along, I’ll sometimes reduce how much water I initially used, and then dump in cold water once the tea has brewed strongly enough. From what I’ve looked up, you want the temp to be at least below 90 degrees. If you don’t have a thermometer: It can be somewhat warm, but shouldn’t be hot. Two comments on this: I brew the tea first thing in the morning, and let it cool throughout the day. By night it has generally cooled off enough. I brew the tea with a smaller amount of water. I try to get just enough so that my diffusers will be submerged. After the tea brews for a while, then I’ll add cold water to the stock pot to get up to my 2-gallon batch. This helps jump-start the cooling process. 19.4.1.2 Basic run-through Once your tea has cooled off, dump it into your big fermentation jug(s) and add the SCOBY. Or add the SCOBY first if you want. It doesn’t matter. If you have and want to keep the mushroom, put that on top. Then cover with a thin, breathable cloth (something like cheesecloth) and let it sit for at least 7-10 days to ferment. I tend to let mine go for about 2 weeks, but I like sour things. After a week or so, you can start tasting. Just use a spoon and scoop a bit of the liquid out. If it’s still a bit sweet, let it go longer. If it’s got a nice sourness, feel free to bottle it up. If you let it go for TOO long, it gets really tart, and starts to resemble apple cider vinegar. Don’t let it get too cold. Cooler temperatures will slow down the fermentation. If it gets too cold, undesirable bacteria or even mold may take root. People say not to have it against an outside wall, but I have and it’s been fine. I think about 60 degrees is on the low end of what still works. 19.4.1.3 Personal comments The jelly mat may sometimes sink, or float sideways, especially as you’re getting started. If you don’t have the mushroom, or if it sinks, your kombucha should form one on top anyway. It might look like mold forming, but it’s not. It’ll start as a thin film, then might form some whitish spots, and eventually a more noticeable white film. If it’s mold, you’ll know, it will usually be fuzzy. At that point you should throw out the whole batch, sterilize everything, and start over. Hopefully you had some extra (like a second batch, or a SCOBY hotel) that you can use to restart. Otherwise go talk to your local hippie again. Initially the mushroom will probably be thin, but if you keep it and put onto the new batches, it’ll get thicker. I don’t think having a thick mushroom provides any benefit. Some people like to brag about it being like an inch or more tall, having a lot of layers like a pancake, etc. To me that’s just taking up more room in the jug. If it starts getting too big for your preference, you can peel it apart (carefully) almost like those flakey biscuits. I’ve had no issues with my kombucha whether the mushroom is 1mm thick, 5mm thick, or if I just toss it any don’t even start the new batch with the mushroom. As I mentioned before, the excess can go into compost (you might want to chop it up), or otherwise you can Google all sorts of weird things people do with it. 19.4.2 Second ferment 19.4.2.1 Basic run-through Once you’re happy with the taste, it’s time to bottle it up. My approach has been: Pour the batch into something that has a much wider top. Scoop out with a measuring cup, and dump into a funnel that goes into the bottle. If you want to add flavoring, you can put some juice or fruit into the bottles at this time (I have some recipes in another section). While bottling, be sure to set aside some of your finished product (before flavoring) to serve as the starter / SCOBY for the next batch. For each gallon you plan to brew, set aside roughly 1.5 - 2 cups. I try to take from the bottom of the jug to get more of the yeast and such. After bottling the kombucha, the bottles should sit out for 3+ days to build up carbonation. Some folks recommend putting them into a plastic bin in case they get over-carbonated and explode (“bottle-bomb”). Literally. Like glass shards all over. I haven’t had this happen, but a friend of mine has. Know what happened? He used a square bottle. The lesson? Don’t use square bottles. After a few days, put them in the fridge, this will stop the fermentation / carbonation from continuing. 19.4.2.2 Personal comments Bottling: Be careful when pouring into the bottles! It might get a bit fizzy, which means either cleaning up afterwards, or having to sit and wait for some fizz to dissipate. It might take a batch or three to get to the point that your fermentation produces a lot of fizz, but it will get there. Flavoring: There are a few routes you can take here. No flavor, just a 1/2 teaspoon or so more sugar. 1.5 oz of “Pure XYZ” juice (personally I avoid the organic versions when possible, because money), or adjust the amount if you want more or less of the flavor. I’ve used the following: Cranberry, Pomegranate, Tart Cherry, and half/half Pineapple and Lime (0.75 of each). The Pineapple-Lime was probably my favorite so far, but I like both pineapple and lime, so … take that how you will. Cherry has been my second favorite. Add fruit or fruit puree to the bottles. Only problem is it might get stuck in the neck. As a warning, using real fruit tends to make the bottles build up a LOT more carbonation and pressure, so they may shoot out like a volcano when you open them. The flavors I’ve tried here have been: Enough chopped up (fresh) ginger root to over the bottom of the bottle, and 0.5 pineapple juice. One peach, chopped/smashed very well and divided between 4 bottles. Both of these were great, and I’m interested in trying some other fruits. Take out enough kombucha from the first fermentation jug to be the next SCOBY, and then add fruit to the big jug and let it sit for a few days. Then strain it out when bottling. I haven’t used this method, so I don’t know how well it works. Carbonating: Sometimes I put the bottles into the fridge right at the 3-4 day mark, other times I keep them out a few more days. So far I haven’t had any problems in terms of bottle bombs. The worst I’ve had is that the Pinapple-Ginger got VERY carbonated and upon opening about a third to half of the bottle fizzed over. But again, DON’T USE SQUARE BOTTLES. Those WILL become bottle-bombs at some point. When I lived in a slightly cooler and less dry climate, I could leave my (round) bottles out for a week and not really have problems with over-carbonation. When I moved to a more dry climate, I’ve found that if I let the bottles sit for a week, they would violently erupt when opened (but not explode, because they were round). I think that I’ve found 3-4 days gets the carbonation to a good place for me, though that may vary throughout the year, depending on the temperature. If you’re concerned about bottle-bombs or kombucha eruptions, you can “burp” the bottles after the first or second day. This should give you an indication of how pressurized they are becoming, and if you should be stopping the fermentation (by putting them into the fridge). 19.4.3 My Routine Like I said, I’ve worked my process into a fairly stable routine. I have two batches of 2 gallons each, offset by a week. So on Saturday or Sunday morning, I’ll make the next batch (“Batch A”) of sweet tea, and set it to cool off (it can take a while). When the tea is cooled enough, I bottle the two gallons that are ready. I try to agitate it a bit, so that the yeast / sediments mix around better. And I try to get roughly 2 cups from the bottom of each jug to set aside as the starter for the next batch. Then I wash out the fermentation jugs, split the SCOBY that I set aside between them, and fill them up with the sweet tea. The next weekend, Batch A is still fermenting (roughly on day 7), so I brew/bottle Batch B, and the process repeats. So, assume you have Batches A1 and B1 from before. Then my timeline is: Week 1: Brew the tea for Batch A2. Bottle Batch A1, and use some to start A2 fermentation. Week 2: Brew the tea for Batch B2. Bottle Batch B1, and use some to start B2 fermentation. Week 3: Brew the tea for batch A3. Bottle Batch A2, and use some to start A3 fermentation. Week 4: Brew the tea for batch B3. Bottle Batch B2, and use some to start B3 fermentation. If you just start with enough SCOBY to start one batch, it might take a little bit to get things settled into this process. Probably you just need to feed it to bulk it up a bit in volume, then use some for a batch, and use the rest for the batch the following week. It’s perfectly fine to let the kombucha go longer than 10-14 days. I’ve read of people letting it go for a month or more. Even if it’s too sour for your taste, it can still be used as a SCOBY. At worst you’d just need to run a couple small batches to kick the yeast back into higher activity. Kombucha is very forgiving in my experience. I sometimes have a little leftover starter after bottling, and I’ll throw it in a jug with some of the extra sweet tea, and it goes along just fine. "],
