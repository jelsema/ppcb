This note will be removed when all of my “regular” recipes are added. Other recipes will get added over time. I may also play with the formatting of the book or adding nutrition information. The “tools” are not always consistently listed. I generally try to list the few major things. Minor things like measuring cups for measuring ingredients, I usually don’t bother. This cookbook is mainly for my own use, though I’ll probably post the link now and again. The name is a homage to the book and movie The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, mainly because of a line from the movie that I’ve co-oped for the subtitle. I’m not a chef by any stretch, so I look up recipes online. But we all know that recipe websites are terrible. They’re either riddled with ads, or have a 3-page story about some rando’s spiritual experience with chives that one time before getting to the recipe. That’s all we’re there for: The ingredients and the directions. That’s what I’m doing here. That is to say, I’m usually not the inventor of these recipes. Sometimes I’ve tweaked them a bit, sometimes not. Usually I’ll provide a link to the original source in case you want to read some story about how garlic is friendly but pepper is moody. Chances are you don’t want to, because that’s stupid. I used to keep recipes I used regularly, or that I liked and wanted to keep around, in a Google Document, but the app would sometimes restart when flipping around tabs. That got annoying, so I decided to write it up in an e-book. Most if not all of the recipes are dairy-free, due to a household need for this. The recipes will just mention “milk” or “butter”, etc, but I’ll have a note about the dairy-free alternative. If you found this, I hope it’s useful. If not, I don’t really care. Also, hopefully you won’t ever read this introduction again, because y’all just want the recipe. "],
["batter.html", " 2 Batters", " 2 Batters A lot of these are basically the same with some slight variations: Flour, Water or milk, Salt, Sugar, Eggs. Switch up the proportions slightly, cook it in something, and top with more sugar - be it powdered, liquified (i.e. syrup, amongst which Maple is king), or fruit - and call it a day morning. "],
["dutch-baby.html", "2.1 Dutch Baby", " 2.1 Dutch Baby A Dutch baby is something weird, sort of a hybrid between a pancake and french toast, maybe. I like it, though I prefer waffles or french toast. Source: I don’t remember. Ingredients: IngredientsTools1/2 cup flourCast iron skillet1/2 cup mulkMixing bowl3 eggsWhisk1-2 tbsp sugarTopping4 tbls butterPowdered sugar1/2 - 1 tsp vanilla extractSyrup (maple)1/2 tsp saltFried chicken1 tsp cinnamonFruit Preparation: Preheat oven to 425. Put butter in skillet and place in oven to melt. Mix all of the other ingredients in a mixing bowl. Once butter is melted and skillet it warm, remove from oven, pour in batter, and return to oven. The skillet should be warm/hot, so that there is an immediate crisping of some of the batter. The whole thing will puff up a lot, but then collapse once you take it out. Bake for 20 minutes. Then reduce temp to 300 and bake 5 more minutes. Variations: Change the amount and/or type of spice to suit your taste. I like cinnamon, nutmeg works. Maybe thyme if you’re weird. Notes: This can be dairy-free by using dairy-free milk and butter. "],
["french-toast-batter.html", "2.2 French Toast batter", " 2.2 French Toast batter Source: Serious Eats. They experimented, and I like their conclusions. Ingredients: IngredientsTools2 eggsMixing bowl2/3 cup milk (??? g)Whisk1/2 tbsp sugarFrying pan Preparation: Set the pan to medium to start heating. Whisk the eggs, then add the rest of the ingredients besides bread. Sprinkle a little bit of sugar on the wet part of the batter when frying. It will carmalize and form a crisp little crust. But be CAREFUL, it will burn easily. Variations: Add some cinnamon to the batter. I forget how much I use, will update next time I made french toast. Notes: This can be dairy-free by using dairy-free milk. Recipie can be increased or decreased, egg-to-milk ratio should be approximately 1/3 cup of milk for each egg (or possibly slightly less, maybe 1/4 cup milk for each egg). the sugar-to-egg ratio should be about 1/4 tbsp sugar per egg.

["waffle-batter.html", "2.3 Waffle batter", " 2.3 Waffle batter Of the breakfast foods made with batter, waffles are the best. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and you can pair it with fruit, syrup, or breaded chicken. This recipe should make 4-8 waffles, depending on the size of your waffle iron. Source: Allrecipes Ingredients: IngredientsTools2 cups flour (320 g)Mixing bowl x23 tbls sugar (40 g)Whisk1/4 - 1 tsp salt (9 g)Measuring cups4 tsp baking powderWaffle iron2 eggsTopping1 3/4 cup milk (400 g)Butter &amp; Syrup (maple, of course)1/2 cup oilFried chicken1/2 - 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extractFruits and whipped cream Preparation: Set the waffle iron to start heating up. Beat the eggs, then add the rest of the wet ingredients (milk, oil, vanilla) and mix. Whisk the dry ingredients (flour, salt, sugar, baking powder) together. I usually do this seperately, but that probably doesn’t matter. Add the wet ingredients to the dry, and mix well. TODO: Measure my waffle iron. Approx 3/4 cup of batter. Variations: For Sourdough Waffles: Use 300 g starter. Reduce milk to 300 g and flour to 175 g. A different version of yeasted waffles, which doesn’t require a sourdough started, is found at post number 5 by “Queen Bruin” here. I tried it once and didn’t find it worth the effort. Notes: This can be dairy-free by using dairy-free milk. Don’t always trust the time on the waffle iron. I just let it cook until it’s basically done steaming, or a bit more. "],

I usually do this seperately, but that probably doesn’t matter. Add the wet ingredients to the dry, and mix, but leave a bit lumpy. Or mix until smooth. It doesn’t matter that much. Put however much you want into the pan at a time. Usually 1/2 - 3/4 cup is good. Flip when the surface gets bubbly. Variations: None that I’ve experimented with. I don’t eat pancakes often.

I suggest using medium heat. Toast the bread. You don’t have to, but toasted &gt; not, so why wouldn’t you? Variations: The recipe above is quite basic. The second column, “Other”, are some extra toppings that I like. They go well individually or together. Bananna pepper mustard might be hard to find, but it’s worth it. If I can find a link to the type I know and love, I’ll put it here. Notes: It’s a sandwich, how difficult can it be? "],

["pizzadough.html", "4.1 Dough", " 4.1 Dough Maybe this belongs in the bread section, I don’t know. But it’s not really intended to be it’s own thing, so I’m putting it here. Don’t like it? Go make your own cookbook. Or just use a different one. Whatever. Source: Several that I sort of amalgamated, mainly AllRecipes, with some elements of Food.com, and Sugardishme IngredientsTools250 g water (approx 1 cup)2 cup measuring cup2 1/4 tsp yeastWhisk8 g sugar (1 - 1 1/2 tsp)Mixing bowl8 g salt (1 - 1 1/2 tsp)Sturdy spoon2 tbsp olive oilCookie sheet415 g cups flour (~2 1/2 cups)Rolling pin Preparation: Warm the water to 100^{} - 110^{} F. Add the yeast and whisk to dissolve. You can add some sugar here as well, I typically add 1/2 teaspoon. In around 5 minutes, the yeast should be bubbling. If it’s not, go back to the beginning. While the yeast is activating, measure out the flour, salt, and sugar into a mixing bowl. Dealer’s choice on whether you want to subtract any sugar used for the yeast from the overall recipe. Or add more, this is your pizza crust. Once the yeast is activated, pour it into the flour and start mixing. After a little bit the dough will start to form and get to a point where you can’t really mix it anymore. There will probably be some parts of the flour that are not fully incorporated in the dough. Once it gets to this point, dump it out onto a lightly floured surface. Make sure to get as much as you can, since you’ll be reusing the bowl. Knead by hand until the dough is somewhat smooth and elastic. You may need to be adding a bit more flour through this process so the dough ball doesn’t stick to your fingers or the counter. When it’s ready or your sick of kneading, form the dough into a ball, spray some oil into the mixing bowl and put the dough back in (as long as the bowl is reasonably clean). Cover it with a dish towel and let it sit to rise. The time you give for rising can vary. If you’re in a hurry, put the dough somewhere warm (e.g., on top of a preheating oven, or in a microwave with a glass of water you just boiled) for 10-15 minutes. If you have more time, you can let it rise for a couple hours. When the dough is ready (doubled in size from rising, or you’re getting hangry), dump it out onto a lightly floured surface (probably the same one as before). Sprinkle some flour on it, and roll it out - gently at first, I usually deflate it with my hands to start. I generally roll it out until it doesn’t really want to strech anymore. Gently lift the dough off the counter, and place it on an oiled cookie sheet or pizza pan. The way I roll it out, there is always extra. Cut off the excess, form a new dough ball and roll it out. Usually there is enough left over for a second (smaller) pizza, or for making garlic bread. You don’t have to, but I like to spray the dough with more olive oil before adding sauce. Then add the toppings you like. Bake the pizza at 425^{} F for 20 minutes. Keep an eye on it the first time or two, since you may want to adjust the time depending on your altitude or oven. Variations: The amounts of salt, sugar, and olive oil are pretty forgiving. I don’t measure the oil anymore, I just pour some from the bottle can call it good. If you know that you will have more or less time, you can adjust the yeast. Less yeast means you’ll need to allow more time for the dough to rise. I’ve cut the yeast in half before, and let the dough rise for 3-4 hours. Notes: I use a kitchen scale to measure ingredients, and adjusted the amounts You can use a stand mixer with dough hook to mix if you want, I find the amount of dough isn’t worth the hassle of using it. Maybe if you’re making multiple batches at once it would be. Directions for garlic bread and recipe for pizza sauce to come. Spoiler alter: The pizza sauce is basically just tomato sauce with a bunch of “Italian” herbs added, plus some salt, garlic, and red pepper flakes. "],
