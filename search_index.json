["index.html", "The Potato-Peel Cookbook No ads, no stories, just recipes 1 Introduction", " The Potato-Peel Cookbook No ads, no stories, just recipes Casey Jelsema Last updated: 2020-04-19 1 Introduction Note: This is still a work in progress. This note will be removed when all of my “regular” recipes are added. Other recipes will get added over time. I may also play with the formatting of the book or adding nutrition information. The “tools” are not always consistently listed. I generally try to list the few major things. Minor things like measuring cups for measuring ingredients, I usually don’t bother. This cookbook is mainly for my own use, though I’ll probably post the link now and again. The name is a homage to the book and movie The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, mainly because of a line from the movie that I’ve co-oped for the subtitle. I’m not a chef by any stretch, so I look up recipes online. But we all know that recipe websites are terrible. They’re either riddled with ads, or have a 3-page story about some rando’s spiritual experience with chives that one time before getting to the recipe. That’s all we’re there for: The ingredients and the directions. That’s what I’m doing here. That is to say, I’m usually not the inventor of these recipes. Sometimes I’ve tweaked them a bit, sometimes not. Usually I’ll provide a link to the original source in case you want to read some story about how garlic is friendly but pepper is moody. Chances are you don’t want to, because that’s stupid. I used to keep recipes I used regularly, or that I liked and wanted to keep around, in a Google Document, but the app would sometimes restart when flipping around tabs. That got annoying, so I decided to write it up in an e-book. Most if not all of the recipes are dairy-free, due to a household need for this. The recipes may just mention “milk” or “butter”, etc, but I’ll have a note about the dairy-free alternative. A word of caution on this: Almond milk is often sweetened and/or flavored with vanilla. That can throw off some of the recipes (especially the gravy). If you do use it, look for unsweetened and unflavored almond milk. If you found this, I hope it’s useful. If not, I don’t really care. Also, hopefully you won’t ever read this introduction again, because y’all just want the recipe. "],

Put butter in skillet and place in oven to melt. Mix all of the other ingredients in a mixing bowl. Once butter is melted and skillet it warm, remove from oven, pour in batter, and return to oven. The skillet should be warm/hot, so that there is an immediate crisping of some of the batter. The whole thing will puff up a lot, but then collapse once you take it out. Bake for 20 minutes. Then reduce temp to 300 and bake 5 more minutes. Variations: Change the amount and/or type of spice to suit your taste. I like cinnamon, nutmeg works. Maybe thyme if you’re weird. Notes: If being diary-free is no concern, you can use regular milk. "],

Whisk the eggs, then add the rest of the ingredients besides bread. Sprinkle a little bit of sugar on the wet part of the batter when frying. It will carmalize and form a crisp little crust. But be CAREFUL, it will burn easily. Variations: Add some cinnamon to the batter. I forget how much I use, will update next time I made french toast. Notes: If being diary-free is no concern, you can use regular milk. Recipie can be increased or decreased, egg-to-milk ratio should be approximately 1/3 cup of milk for each egg (or possibly slightly less, maybe 1/4 cup milk for each egg). the sugar-to-egg ratio should be about 1/4 tbsp sugar per egg.

["waffle-batter.html", "2.3 Waffle batter", " 2.3 Waffle batter Of the breakfast foods made with batter, waffles are the best.

I usually do this seperately, but that probably doesn’t matter. Add the wet ingredients to the dry, and mix well. TODO: Measure my waffle iron. Approx 3/4 cup of batter. Variations: For Sourdough Waffles: Use 300 g starter. Reduce milk to 300 g and flour to 175 g. A different version of yeasted waffles, which doesn’t require a sourdough started, is found at post number 5 by “Queen Bruin” here. I tried it once and didn’t find it worth the effort. Notes: If being diary-free is no concern, you can use regular milk. Don’t always trust the time on the waffle iron. I just let it cook until it’s basically done steaming, or a bit more. "],

["biscuits.html", "3.2 Biscuits", " 3.2 Biscuits Technically biscuits are more versatile than just using them for biscuits and gravy, but what’s the point? Source: MinimalistBaker Ingredients: IngredientsTools1 cup almond milkMixing bowl1 tbsp lemon juice / apple cider vinagerMeasuring cup275 g flour (~2 cups)Mixing spoon1/2 tbsp baking sodaKnife/Dough scraper3/4 tsp salt9x9 pan4 tbsp butter Preparation: Preheat the oven to 450° F. Mix the almond milk and lemon juice or apple cider vinager. This will simulate buttermilk. Let it stand for at least 5 minutes. Whisk together dry ingredients. Cut the butter (if you used sticks, which I suggest) into small chunks and mix it in with the flour. Just use your fingers to smash the pieces further and try to incorporate it as well as possible. The more distributed it gets, the better. But don’t use melted butter, and try to work quickly so that the butter doesn’t melt from your hands. Pour in the “buttermilk” mixture. Stir until just slightly combined, the dough will be very sticky. Dump it out onto floured surface, dust the top with some flour, and fold the dough over itself a few times (5-6 should be fine). You’ll probably want to dust your hands with flour now and again. Your hands WILL become a sticky mess. DO NOT KNEAD THE DOUGH. Handle the dough as little as possible. Otherwise you lose fluffiness and biscuits become more hard (I think). Form the dough into a rough square/disk approximately 3/4 - 1 inch thick. Use a dough cutter, knife, or cookie cutter to cut out the biscuits. Place them in greased baking sheet/pan. They should touch slightly (this helps them to rise). Brush tops of biscuits with melted butter (another 1/4 - 1/2 tbsp) and gently make a small divot in the center (using 1-2 fingers). This helps prevent “dome” forming from biscuits. Bake for 10-15 minutes, until the bisuits are fluffy and turning golden brown. Eat those bad boys while they’re warm! Preferably with sausage gravy. Variations: Cinnamon roll biscuts are pretty good. I actually like them better than “ordinary” cinnamon rolls. Notes: Of course, swap out the butter for dairy-free butter to make this fully dairy-free. The original recipe was for vegan biscuits, hence the almond milk in the instructions. If you don’t are about being vegan or dairy-free, you can swap out both of those ingredients for buttermilk. "],
["cinnamon-roll-biscuits.html", "3.3 Cinnamon roll biscuits", " 3.3 Cinnamon roll biscuits Okay, so this is at least one good use for biscuits other then biscuits and gravy. Source: No particular source, just made it up (we were out of both eggs and breakfast sausage one day). Ingredients: DoughFillingTools1 cup almond milk2 tbsp cinnamonMixing bowls1 tbsp lemon juice / apple cider vinager2 tbsp brown/coconut sugarMixing spoon275 g flour (~2 cups)GlazeKnife/Dough scraper1/2 tbsp baking soda1 cup powdered sugar9x9 pan3/4 tsp salt2 tbsp dairy free butterI didn't keep track of everything4 tbsp butter1 tbsp almond milkStop complaining, this is all free1 tsp vanilla extractIncluding ad-free Preparation: Preheat the overn to 450° F. Make the dough from the biscuit recipie. Mix the filling in a small dish. Very tricky, this step. As you are folding the dough over itself, spread some of the filling in it to fold into the dough. I wound up using two folds for this. Try to aim for making a “long” rectangle rather than a square. Then on your last fold, roll the dough instead of folding it. It might look terrible, and that’s fine, I won’t judge how your cinnamon rolls look. Use a knife or dough scraper to slice the log of dough into disks, about 1 - 1.5 inches thick. Place them in the baking pan. They can touch each other, or there can be a bit of space, it doesn’t matter that much. Brush the topcs with some melted butter and bake for 10-15 minutes. While the biscuits are baking, you can make the glaze. If you do this well before the biscuits are done cooking, it will have a chance to congeal slightly. Melt the butter. Add the powdered sugar, almond milk, and vanilla extract and whisk until smooth. When the cinnamon biscuits are done, try to let them cool before drizzling with the glaze, as that will help prevent it from all running down the sides. If you let he glaze cool a bit, that will also help in this regard. Variations: You should throw some butter on these when you go to eat them. But that’s redundant with cinnamon rolls, right? Notes: If being diary-free is no concern, you can use regular milk and butter. I like these better than “ordinary” cinnamon rolls that use a yeasted dough. "],
["sausage-gravy.html", " 4 Sausage gravy", " 4 Sausage gravy A staple of the South, this is basically a must-have to go along with biscuits. Source: Passed-down directions. Ingredients: IngredientsToolsBreakfast sausageFrying pan or skilletFlourSpoon or forkAlmond milk Preparation: In the pan/skillet, fry the sausage. Smash it a bit to make it produce more grease. The more the better. Add approximately equal parts almond milk and stir together. The milk should start to cook off so that the gravy thickens up. Add salt and pepper to taste. If you want more, add more flour and milk. If it’s too runny, add some flour only, or let some of hte milk cook off. Put it on fresh biscuits and get fat enjoy. Add a sausage patty on the biscuit as well. Variations: Use bacon instead of sausage. Not as great with the resulting gravy, in my opinion, but is a source of grease. Plus, you get bacon. If the sausage didn’t break up at all, you may want to add some bits of the sausage back into he gravy. Notes: Breakfast sausage comes in many forms. I try to avoid links or pre-made patties, as I think they tend to produce less grease, and less little bits of sausage that fall off to get mixed in with the gravy. I mentioned this in the introduction, but for this recipe especially, don’t use sweetened or flavored almond milk. It’ll still work, but it definitely changes the flavor in a way that I don’t really like. "],
["huevos-rancheros.html", "4.1 Huevos Rancheros", " 4.1 Huevos Rancheros A popular southwest / Mexican style breakfast. I view it a bit like a pizza: There’s a generally agreed-upon basis, but plenty of room for variation. Below is how I like to make them. Source: Experimentation. Ingredients: IngredientsTools1/8 lb chorizo sausageAll of your frying pans1-2 EggsSpatulaBlack beansCornChile (green or red)Tortilla Preparation: Start frying the chorizo. Personally, I like to break it up into many chunks and fry it to the point that it gets a bit crispy or crunchy. While the chorizo is frying, put some chile, beans, and corn into a smaller pan and set it on very low heat. It’s just supposed to get warm. I throw some olive oil in the pan as well. If you don’t have chile, you can use salsa as a substitute, but know that I’m judging you for it. When the chorizo is done, put it on a plate and crash 1-2 eggs into the pan. Prepare them how you like, my preference is over-medium, but scrambled is also good. While the egg is cooking, use another pan to crisp the tortilla. Depending on how quickly your eggs finish, you might need to start this before the eggs. When the tortilla has a bit of crisp (on both sides), put it on your plate, add the eggs, add some of the chile/corn/bean mixture, and add the chorizo. Variations: If you would rather your tortilla be soft, don’t fry it (one less pan, hooray!). You can just use it plain, or microwave it slightly. I like to add several more things to my huevos rancheros: Home fries, guacamole, cheese, and sometimes a drizzle of southwest dressing. Notes: Chorizo often comes in 1-pound packages. I ususally make huevos rancheros for two, so it’s easy to cook up 1/4 of the package. I tend to have a black bean and corn mixture on hand (literally just a can of black beans, and a can of corn, both drained, and then dumped into the same bowl). It goes great on salads, quesadillas, this, and probably more that I’m forgetting. If you don’t have that, you may want to make sure you have enough people to make brakfast for, have other uses for the corn and beans, or forgo the corn and beans. "],
["breakfast-scramble.html", "4.2 Breakfast scramble", " 4.2 Breakfast scramble This is a favorite of mine (though I like the huevos rancheros better). Very easy, filling, and delicious. Plenty of room for variation as well. Source: Imitating a fairly common restaurant dish. Ingredients: IngredientsTools2-3 medium red potatoesFrying pan/skillet x21/8 lb breakfast sausageSpatulas1-2 EggsOnionGreen pepperCooking oil Preparation: Set your skillet (if you have one, frying pan if not) to heating. I tend to do this at medium to medium/high heat. Dice up the potatoes. I usually make them into chunks about 1/4-1/2 inch. No need to peel them, just wash and cut off any roots that may have started growing. Throw some high-heat oil (such as avocado oil) or bacon grease into the skillet (if you have one, regular frying pan if not), and the dump in the potatoes. Be careful of oil/grease splattering. Stir the potatoes around to get them all coated with the oil, and then spread them as evenly as you can. In another pan, start frying the sausage. Occassionally stir the potatoes around so that they get crisped on all sides (this is the reason for the medium/high heat). Sautee a handful of diced onion and green peppers in a seperate pan (could be the one you used for sausage). Once the sausage is done, you can add it to the potatoes. Once your potatoes are almost done, start frying your egg(s) however you like. Scrambled works great, though I prefer over-medium. Mix up the potatoes, sausage, and onion/green peppers. Add the eggs on top, salt and pepper to taste. Variations: Drizzle some BBQ sauce over the top. I rather like BBQ Carnivores sauces for this. Cheese is a good addition to this dish. Instead of breakfast sausage, you can use bacon (though I don’t think it works quite as well), pulled pork, or brisket. Notes: A slice of toast with butter complements this meal very nicely. You can put the onion and green pepper in with the potatoes, but then the potatoes tend to absorb the moisture and lose their crispyness, which I don’t like. "],

Puree approximately 1/3 of the soup, then return it to the pot and stir it in. Variations: Add 3 tablespoons of fresh lime juice. If including rice, add at time of consumption. Notes: No need to drain the black beans, it just adds a bit of juice to the soup. You can blend one of the cans of beans (and some small amounts of other ingredients) independently, before adding them to the soup. I think the cooked beans blend better, though. "],

Add the yeast and whisk to dissolve. You can add some sugar here as well, I typically add 1/2 teaspoon. In around 5 minutes, the yeast should be bubbling. If it’s not, go back to the beginning. While the yeast is activating, measure out the flour, salt, and sugar into a mixing bowl. Dealer’s choice on whether you want to subtract any sugar used for the yeast from the overall recipe. Or add more, this is your pizza crust. Once the yeast is activated, pour it into the flour and start mixing. After a little bit the dough will start to form and get to a point where you can’t really mix it anymore. There will probably be some parts of the flour that are not fully incorporated in the dough. Once it gets to this point, dump it out onto a lightly floured surface. Make sure to get as much as you can, since you’ll be reusing the bowl. Knead by hand until the dough is somewhat smooth and elastic. You may need to be adding a bit more flour through this process so the dough ball doesn’t stick to your fingers or the counter. When it’s ready or your sick of kneading, form the dough into a ball, spray some oil into the mixing bowl and put the dough back in (as long as the bowl is reasonably clean). Cover it with a dish towel and let it sit to rise. The time you give for rising can vary. If you’re in a hurry, put the dough somewhere warm (e.g., on top of a preheating oven, or in a microwave with a glass of water you just boiled) for 10-15 minutes. If you have more time, you can let it rise for a couple hours. When the dough is ready (doubled in size from rising, or you’re getting hangry), dump it out onto a lightly floured surface (probably the same one as before). Sprinkle some flour on it, and roll it out - gently at first, I usually deflate it with my hands to start. I generally roll it out until it doesn’t really want to strech anymore. Gently lift the dough off the counter, and place it on an oiled cookie sheet or pizza pan. The way I roll it out, there is always extra. Cut off the excess, form a new dough ball and roll it out. Usually there is enough left over for a second (smaller) pizza, or for making garlic bread. You don’t have to, but I like to spray the dough with more olive oil before adding sauce. Then add the toppings you like. Bake the pizza at 425^{} F for 20 minutes. Keep an eye on it the first time or two, since you may want to adjust the time depending on your altitude or oven. Variations: The amounts of salt, sugar, and olive oil are pretty forgiving. I don’t measure the oil anymore, I just pour some from the bottle can call it good. If you know that you will have more or less time, you can adjust the yeast. Less yeast means you’ll need to allow more time for the dough to rise. I’ve cut the yeast in half before, and let the dough rise for 3-4 hours. Notes: I use a kitchen scale to measure ingredients, and adjusted the amounts You can use a stand mixer with dough hook to mix if you want, I find the amount of dough isn’t worth the hassle of using it. Maybe if you’re making multiple batches at once it would be. Directions for garlic bread and recipe for pizza sauce to come.

IngredientsToolsExtra pizza doughRolling pinDairy-free butterKnifeGarlic powderBaking sheet/panParsleySalt Preparation: Make the pizza dough. The amounts I listed should accomodate an ordinary cookie sheet pizza, and have some leftover dough. Collect the scrap dough and form a dough ball. This will take a little bit to properly incorporate the scraps together. Roll out the new dough ball. You can roll it very thin if you like. Slather the top with butter. Like, a lot of it. It’s difficult to have too much here, I’m not sure that I’ve ever done so. Sprinkle with garlic powder (a lot), parsley (some), and salt (some). Very precise, I know. Set aside as the pizza cooks. The garlic bread should start to rise a bit, which is good. When the pizza is done, bake the garlic bread for approximatley 7 minutes. I think it’s done before all of the butter has cooked off. If it gets to that point, it usually means the garlic bread will be a bit more dry and/or crispy. Which, hey, if that’s what you like, more power so you. I don’t think this type of garlic bread is suited to being overly crispy. Variations: You can’t go wrong adding cheese (mozzerella and/or Provelone, naturally). Or Parmesan once it’s done baking. Notes: For the salt, it’s better if you have the style with larger grains/crystals (sea salt or other varieties mistakenly called sea salt, such as rock salt). This type of salt will get you the nice texture. If you’re in a hurry and don’t want to make the dough (or don’t have any extra), you can use a French bread instead. Cut it in half as if you’re making a sub sandwich and load it with butter. I like to cut 1-2 grooves lengthwise to get more butter into the bread. "],

I think I swapped out on an equal-volume basis, and microwaved hte honey slightly so it would be easier to pour out of the measuring cup. Adding bacon bits and green chile (mixed into the batter) is great. If you don’t have proper green chile available, you can use jalapeño like a peasant. Notes: I like the Indian Head cornmeal. And since I got the recipie from their package, I think it’s only fair to recommend them for this. The top may crack during cooking. That’s fine. It’s good for the cornbread to be soft and moist, but you do want it fully cooked. Using a toothpick test is probably a good idea. "],

I’ve used it as an appetizer with chips/crackers, put it on a roll, and make a grilled cheese with it. This is a dairy-free recipe (optionally vegan), but that makes the ingredient list a bit verbose, so I’ll list some options below. Source: AllRecipes, but I modified it to be dairy-free. Ingredients: Ingredients 8 oz cream cheese1/4 tsp garlic powder1/2 cup mayonnaise1/4 tsp paprika2 cups shredded cheddar cheese4 oz diced pimentos, drained1/4 tsp onion powderSalt and pepper to taste Preparation: Mix the cream cheese and mayonnaise together. Once the cream cheese and mayonnaise start to come together, add in the spices and continue mixing. Then add in the pimentos and continue mixing. Add the cheddar cheese shreds and mix well. Store in sealed container, seems to last pretty well. Might just be because pimento cheese is delicious and doesn’t last that long. Variations: Some of the following can be added to tweak the recipie slightly: Bacon bits (smoked is better) 1/4 tsp ground cayenne pepper 1 jalapeño pepper, de-seeded and minced I haven’t tried it yet, but adding some green chile would probably be good as well. If you use Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise, you may want to add white vinegar. I forget the amount, maybe1/4 cup or so. This helps mellow out the sweetness of the Miracle Whip, but does change the texture of the cheese to be a little bit more runny. Just use Duke’s mayo. Why don’t you have that stuff on hand anyway?
