This note will be removed when all of my “regular” recipes are added. Other recipes will get added over time. I may also play with the formatting of the book or adding nutrition information. This cookbook is mainly for my own use, though I’ll probably post the link now and again. I’m not a chef by any stretch, so I look up recipes online. But we all know that recipe websites are terrible. They’re either riddled with ads, or have a 3-page story about some rando’s spiritual experience with chives that one time before getting to the recipe. That’s all we’re there for: The ingredients and the directions. That’s what I’m doing here. That is to say, I’m usually not the inventor of these recipes. Sometimes I’ve tweaked them a bit, sometimes not. Usually I’ll provide a link to the original source in case you want to read some story about how garlic is friendly but pepper is moody. Chances are you don’t want to, because that’s stupid. I used to kept recipes I used regularly, or that I liked and wanted to keep around, in a Google Document, but the app would sometimes restart when flipping around tabs. That got annoying, so I decided to write it up in an e-book. If you found this, I hope it’s useful. If not, I don’t really care. Also, hopefully you won’t ever read this introduction again, because y’all just want the recipe.
